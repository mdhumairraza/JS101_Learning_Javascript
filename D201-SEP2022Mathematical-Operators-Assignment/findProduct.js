// # Problem 2 : Double All

// ### Description

// - You have to take five numbers, stored in the variables with the following names
    
//     ```
//     one, two, three, four, five
//     ```
    
// - All the values are doubled, that is, they are multiplied by 2

// Find the sum of the values stored in`one, two, three, four`, after the above operation are performed

// ### Input

// The first and the only line of the input contains the values stored in variables`one, two, three, four, five`

// ### Output

// Print the sum of the values stored in`one, two, three, four,five`, after the required operation is performed

// ### Sample Input

// ```jsx
// 1 2 3 4 5
// ```

// ### Sample Output

// ```jsx
// 30
// ```

// ### Hint

// In the sample test case, the values stored in the variables are as follows

// ```
// one = 1, two = 2, three = 3, four = 4, five = 5

// ```

// After doubling all the values, the values become

// ```
// one = 1*2 = 2

// two = 2*2 = 4

// three = 3*2 = 6

// four = 4*2 = 8

// five = 5*2 = 10

// ```

// Therefore, the sum becomes`2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 30`, which is the required output






var one ;
